	<h3>About me.</h3>

	<p>Hi, my name is Jamie Anne Liistro, I’m 25 and live in Melbourne. I was born in Australia to my Australian Mother and Italian father. My mother was born here in Melbourne and my father was born in Solerino, Sicily and migrated from Italy when he was just 3 years old. I have lived, worked and studied in Melbourne all my life. </p>

	<p>My favourite technology based past times are</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Building and fixing PCs, it’s a great way for me to learn new things about software and hardware. </li>
		<li>Playing PC and VR games.</li>
		<li>3D printing and CAD. </li>
	</ul>

	<p>My favourite non technological past times are</p>
	<ul>

		<li>Hiking and camping around Victoria. I hope to go interstate or overseas to camp as well. I would love to try camping in the snow when I improve my survival skills. </li>
		<li>Fishing. I live close to the Yarra Valley, there are some great fishing spots around there.  </li>
		<li>Riding motorbikes, something I have been doing since the age of 8. </li>
		<li>Astronomy. I own a number of telescopes and enjoy learning about space and space exploration.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Before I began my journey into higher education, I attended Eltham High School. I was a member of the swim team. I was quite well known around the school and gained the nick name, “flipper” (which I wasn’t a real fan of).  I left EHS half way through year 11 when my mum needed someone to take care of her health. During this time, I worked some jobs in the hospitality industry and worked my way up to managing a Shisha bar called Shisha Square, where I met my partner Khaled who was the owner at the time. 
	</p>

	<p>
		At the end of 2016 I decided to leave my job and study IT Networking at Holmesglen Chadstone. I started in 2017 and studied part time, finishing at the end of 2018.
	</p>

	<p>I now work nights, organising my partners accounts for his current business and am studying Introduction to IT and Introduction to Programming at RMIT University, online. 
		Next year I hope to study a Bachelor Degree in IT at RMIT.
