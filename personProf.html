	<h3>What did the results mean for me?</h3>
	<p>I think the tests were somewhat accurate. I am a very easy-going person and most inconveniences or stressful situations, whether they are from an event or a person, don’t really get to me emotionally so discovering I was only 11% perceiving, was something I didn’t entirely agree with. The tests showed that I was able to think abstractly and enjoyed playing with ideas and was open to others ideas which is certainly something I can relate to. I enjoy reading about experimental and interesting technologies and imagining how they would work and how they can be used. The results also showed that I was highly extraverted, which means I seek attention, I think the test mistook my enjoyment of socialisation as a desire for attention, which is not something that I actually enjoy. I tend to be a very outgoing person because I enjoy interacting with others but I don’t find attention seeking very gratifying. I think the learning style results were very accurate, I retain information much better when listening to something or actually doing a practical activity more than if I was to just read about how to do something.

	<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>
		As an apparent extrovert, I suppose I should be careful not to overpower others in the group by talking too much or going off track and having a chat instead of getting the work done. My empathy level appears to be quite low (a little lower than I think or hope it actually is) so I should take time to be mindful of others feelings when they are expressing themselves. I can be very agreeable, sometimes to a fault so if I see something is going on that I don’t necessarily agree with, I will do my best to make my opinion heard. I should watch out for my tendency to do things unconventionally, especially because unconventional methods are, unconventional, and sometimes don’t work as well as tried and trusted methods. The following projects will be in teams and I don’t want to do something that jeopardises the results of the entire team. I use a lot of video resources because that is the way I prefer to learn, hopefully I can provide the team with some useful videos and podcasts that I have found useful in the past to learn certain skills.   
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>
		I hope my results reflect that I am open to others ideas and enjoy listening to what other people have to say, getting feedback from other people perspective is something that is very important to me in group work. I will probably tend to seek out videos and practical scenarios to get our projects done. I will probably have to let the team know that I may need a little more time if we need to do a lot of reading for a project as it takes me longer to absorb information in that way. Hopefully I will be able to bring my open mindedness and flexibility to adapt to what others would like to do and just go with the flow, giving input when I feel I need to. I am very agreeable and I really don’t mind doing something if others are very passionate about it so I think this will allow me to be easy-going and relinquish a lot of control from the project, I shouldn’t have any problems allowing others to express themselves and I think I would encourage it. I’m not particularly neurotic so hopefully I can bring some reassurance and calm to others who might be feeling stressed or anxious about the project’s completion.
