	<h3>What did the results mean for me?</h3>
	<p>The MBTI test labelled me as a “Craftsman”. I am adventurous and independent. I enjoy situations that challenge me and am unafraid when faced with uncertainty. I am good at solving problems and enjoy when I can learn something in a practical scenario as opposed to a theoretical one. I have a lot of inward energy and enjoy my time alone. I prefer to solve problems on my own and am very practical in my methods. I think objectively and logically and tend to make decisions with my head rather than my heart. I prefer to work alone and am adept at problem solving. I am mostly a tactile learner, so I learn best when I have practical tasks and physical movement to help me learn a skill. I find when working on projects, the act of touch typing helps me focus and stay still! I also benefit greatly from visual aids such as videos and diagrams.
		My weaknesses are; difficulty with long term planning, feeling uneasy in emotional situations, feeling trapped easily and that I can get in trouble when initiating actions. I struggle with long term planning and often find I do most of my work at the last minute. I felt these results were relatively accurate, apart from a few minor points such as feeling trapped and being introverted. Otherwise I was vey surprised at how well it measured my personality.

	<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
	<p>
		I will need to communicate with my team and make sure my own schedule is aligned with theirs. It will be very important to the success of the team as a whole that I keep on track with the tasks we have set out to do. If I have an issue, I will need to let my team know that I have encountered a speed bump, even if they are unable or unwilling to assist me. I would benefit from being in a team with others who are able to quickly read and accurately explain information.  I will need to remain focused no matter what the study material is, I may not have the option to access additional information in the format that suits me best and need to be a reliable member of my team. I should ask myself what positive attributes I have learned from the test and find ways to apply them to helping others. I should also be careful not to be so averse to sticking to tried and tested methods as my openness can make me want to find new and unconventional ways to perform tasks which may result in failure.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
	<p>
		I think my positive attitude will help other members of the team to feel hopeful and excited about completing milestones. I enjoy making others happy and encouraging people, hopefully I can help my team in this way. I should be able to avoid confrontation in the group because I am an agreeable person and am able to tolerate disagreeable behaviour. My conscientious behaviour should help me stay on track and prioritise what needs to be done and my extraverted tendencies may help me to implement these changes. I may be useful when complicated diagrams are involved as I find it easy to quickly understand these sorts of visual aids. I have decent self-discipline and control over prioritising what needs to be done. I am not very neurotic so I can hopefully being a positive attitude to the team when we are on a tight deadline.
