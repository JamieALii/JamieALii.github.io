	<h2>About me</h2>

	<p>
		Hi my name is Jamie Anne Liistro, I am 25 and I live in Melbourne, Victoria. I love being around computers and technology and learning as much as I possibly can about it. I grew up living between my mother’s house in Melbourne and my dad’s farm near Kilmore, so I really had the best of both worlds, going to school in Melbourne and spending weekends and holidays on the farm with dad. I attended Eltham High, was a member of the swim team which I really excelled in but ended up leaving school half way through year 11 due to family circumstances. I spent a few years working in the hospitality industry and eventually went to Holmesglen institute to complete a Certificate IV in Information Technology, Networking. </p>

My cultural background is a mix of Italian and Scandinavian (which is the origin of my surname) on my father’s side and European and a little east Asian on my mothers’ side. </p>
<p>

One thing people may not know about me is that one of my favourite hobbies is amateur astronomy. I have quite a few telescopes of varying sizes and enjoy the practice of manually locating planets and galaxies. My favourite planet to look at is Saturn because the shadow from the ring really defines the planet as this huge looming monolith, way out there in space. I really enjoy astronomy because the telescope opens up an incredible view of galaxy’s, nebula and stars that we would never have known were there if we just looked at the sky with the naked eye. I also love astronomy because when we look at stars, we are looking into the past and I think that fact is just incredible.
