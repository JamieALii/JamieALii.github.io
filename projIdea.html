	<h1 class="center">Automatic soil moisture and PH monitoring system</h1>
	<br>


	

	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>
		For my project, I would like to create a semi-automated garden watering and garden care system. The system will consist of a watering line, connected to an automated tap valve, garden probes to monitor soil moisture and PH and this will be controlled via a smartphone app. The app can be used to alert the user when the probes detect a PH change and it will also retrieve data from the probes and determine a watering schedule for the garden. The app will also allow the user to adjust watering system settings (we are all aware of Australia’s water restrictions). The app will also be used to configure the probes and address them with an ID name, just like any smart home device.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Why could this project be useful?</h3>

	<p>
		Plants are diverse and varied, some plants like ferns require little attention to thrive, while other plants like orchids and certain vegetables and fruits need attentive care to yield desirable results. Australia also has some very specific restrictions on when and how you can water a garden, particularly large gardens. I wanted to create a smart watering system, that allowed the user to specify conditions like “Only water between dusk and dawn” or “only water on X, X, X, days of the week”. I also wanted to create a system that replaced the act of taking multiple soil samples around the garden to validate soil PH, as this is a necessary (but tedious) task, especially when growing fruits and vegetables. 
	</p>

	<h2 class="center">Product description</h2>
	<h3>Smart Valve</h3>
	<p>
		The valve will be a standard tap valve that is seen in most analogue tap timers. The internal mechanism will work in the same way, where it opens the valve when it is powered and closes the valve when the power is cut off (this prevents flooding in the event of a power delivery failure). For the valve to work, the water at the tap is always turned on. The smart valve, replaces the manual valve in a standard tap. The smart valve is Wi-Fi connected (through the app) and is able to be triggered by the smartphone app, if the user wants to override the automated system. The valve is powered with a solar panel that can be clipped onto the device and also comes with an extension cable (much like solar powered Christmas lights) so the panel can be placed elsewhere, if the users tap is under cover. 

		</p>
		<br>

		<h3>Watering System</h3>

		<p>
			The watering system consists of a standard poly tubing that connects to the valve, like a hose and is run throughout the garden, where water is needed. The poly hose is fitted with small jet sprinklers that are placed on the line at the intervals of the users choosing. This procedure follows the standard construction of most garden watering systems and can be done with a pair of hands and a sharp knife, so it’s pretty user friendly. The sprinklers themselves do not turn on independently, when the valve activates, water is sent through the system and out of all of the sprinklers. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Garden Probes</h3>
	<p>
		The probes will be placed into different areas of the garden, like a series of vegetable patches or amongst rows of different types of fruit trees. The probes will have two prongs, one for moisture and one for PH. The housing for the electronics and Bluetooth transmitter will be made of UV resistant plastic and will have a solar panel on top to provide power. 
Each probe can be addressed with a name and told to monitor a specific PH level so the user can receive alerts from the app and determine which area of the garden needs attention. This procedure would be much like placing smart switches and bulbs around the home and addressing them with names and conditions for how they operate. 
The probes will transfer data to the tap valve via Bluetooth and the valve will relay information to the app via Wi-Fi. This allows the probes to be placed out of Wi-Fi range and reduces the number of devices connected to the home Wi-Fi. 
	</p>
	<br>
		<h3>Smartphone App</h3>

		<p>
			The app will be used to address the probes and control the probe settings and view the weekly watering schedule for past and present. PH and moisture data would also be listed in the app so the user can monitor it in real time. Future iterations could also include a database of plant types that the user can choose from, when configuring the probes, to make the whole experience of selecting PH much easier. Additionally, the app could suggest nutrient products to the user when they are having PH issues and a link to purchase those products online or in store could be added as an additional feature. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Tools and technologies</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A standard, manual, garden watering system, purchased from a local hardware store (poly tube and sprinklers).  </li>
		<li>A digital or analogue tap valve that can be refitted to receive the smart technology and mechanical components.</li>
		<li>The housings for the valve and probes can be 3D printed with ABS or PETG plastic for the prototypes, but to ensure longevity, will need to be vacuum formed, using UV resistant plastics. </li>
		<li>Solar panel kits for powering DIY electronics.</li>
		<li>Arduino/ Ras Pi will need to be used for the smart technology inside the probes and valve. </li>
		<li>PH and moisture sensors for Arduino in the probes.</li>
		<li>An app will need to be coded with parameters for the watering and alert system and a simple user interface will need to be created.  </li>

	</ul>
	<br>

	<h3>Skills required</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Skills in coding for Arduino/Ras Pi and smartphone app.</li>
		<li>Electronics and construction skills to create the probes and refit the tap valve.</li>
		<li>App development and coding skills.</li>
		<li>Configuring smart connected devices. </li>
		<li>CAD modelling and 3D printer use skills to create the 3D printed prototypes. </li>
		<li>Gardening knowledge. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		I think all of this technology is feasible to set up in the home with consumer and enthusiast technologies and tools. With enough time and research this is a project that could be accomplished by most people who have the time and dedication to learn the different aspects of the project’s construction. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Outcome</h3>
	<p>The outcome would be to produce a reliable system for watering and soil PH testing in targeted areas of the garden. It would enable the user to leave their garden unattended for longer periods of time, without worrying so much about time consuming activities such as watering and testing soil PH. The system would also allow people who are away from home to monitor and care for their gardens without human intervention. The project would also help people who are busy and are unable to commit to garden care within the restricted times that Australia’s water restrictions demand. </p>
