	<h2>Companion robot for the elderly</h2>

	<br>

	<h3>Overview.</h3>
	<p>
		My project idea is to create a robot assistant for elderly people. Virtual assistants now days often seem more advanced than they actually are and I have seen first hand how the elderly often struggle to remember the specific commands i.e. “Ok Google, play Yellow Submarine by the Beetles” to play music. My assistant would be a small robot that is able to follow people around, detect falls and dangerous situations such as spills and gas leaks, and would be programmed with an AI that is more proficient in recognising natural speech and is able to ask questions instead of trying to smartly assume what the person said and output an instant search.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>Motivation.</h3>
	<p>
		I was motivated to come up with this idea by my mother who suffered damage to the speech portion of her brain, she also has trouble with short term memory and struggles with remembering the commands and word flow of how to talk to todays standard virtual assistants. She also is prone to the risk of falls and could be greatly helped if she had a guardian robot watching over her who can assess dangerous situations and respond to queries. She also struggles to link a long sentence together when communicating with virtual assistants and watching her interactions always gives me ideas for how the interaction could be improved (if I knew how to do that). 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Appearance.</h3>
	<p>
		The robot will stand approximately 50cm tall, about the height of a bed side table. It will be made from a metal chassis for rigidity and a smooth plastic outer shell that can be shipped in customised colours. The robot will take on a humanoid/friendly/cute appearance to appeal to older people and seem more friendly. It will not have arms or any grabbing functionality yet. The “head” of the robot will be a Mycroft virtual assistant <!--Add link here to MyCroft-->. 

		<br>

		The robot will travel on a three-wheel system, driven by the back wheel with rear wheel turning. The front wheels will be larger so the robot is able to run over obstacles such as power chords and carpet and the rear wheel will be smaller and wider to give it the ability to efficiently push the robot along. The rear wheel steering makes the robot very manoeuvrable around tight corners and in small spaces. 

	</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Internal structure.</h3>
	<p>
		The internal structure of the robot is modelled on the idea of an empty PC chassis. Where the person who builds the computer can move some components around, improve the internal cooling and modify and upgrade existing components. 
		Many elderly people who need these types of devices don’t have a lot of money to spend on purchasing whole new devices every few years so the aim is to make it as affordable and repairable as possible. To achieve this, the internals will be fully modular and upgradeable and I would attempt to use as many, off the shelf parts instead of proprietary parts to make pricing for upgrades and fixes comparable to the current computer/robotics market. The internal computer system will be fully assembled with no permanently soldered major components, allowing upgrades to any component if it malfunctions. If the battery wares down, it can be replaced, if the hardware slows over time, it can be replaced, if a better resolution tablet is released, it can be replaced, etc. 
		<br>

		The battery packs will be at the base of the internal system, giving the robot a low centre of gravity and less likely to topple over. The PC components that run the AI and connect the tablets power systems will be in the mid-section with some room between it and the battery for good airflow. Subtle vents worked into the external design and low powered, silent fans, strategically placed around the internals will promote air flow and keep the battery and other components cool. 
	</p>

	<h3>Functions.</h3>
	<p>
		The robot would run on the Mycroft AI which is a very versatile, open source software. The software can be run on a raspberry Pi and used to control sensors for sight, sound output, hearing, gas sensing, robotic movement and smart home control. The AI also needs to have the basic functions of a standard personal assistant. It should be able to set reminders, alarms and search, the internet, features that MyCroft already has. I would like to see the robot have the ability to eventually return to a docking station and self-charge when its batteries are low. I would also like it to be able to autonomously traverse a house and make a virtual map of the rooms so it can move more independently around the home, if needed. 
	</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Tools and Technologies. </h3>

	<p>
		<b>Software:</b> A Raspberry Pi, running MyCroft. The AI is open source and will need to be expanded upon to include the functionality of the sensors, boards and motors on the Raspberry Pi to work cohesively with the communication of the AI.<br>

		<b>Hardware:</b> Raspberry Pi and compatible gas sensors, 2.4Ghz WiFi module, camera module, distance sensor, servo motors, servo board, battery pack with charging dock. <br>

		<b>Frame:</b> The frame will need to be fabricated using aluminium and the external cover could be 3D printed or vacuum formed from ABS plastic for durability. <br>
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Skills Required. </h3>
	<p>
		Extensive coding skills are required to achieve this project. The person that does the coding would require excellent knowledge of the functions and features of Arduino, Raspberry Pi modules and the Python coding language to alter Mycroft to include the necessary features. Skills in metal fabrication and 3D cad modelling would also be ideal so third-party companies don’t need to be hired for the body construction. Skills in Rasp Pi and Arduino construction and a good knowledge of electronics to assemble the internal components and construct a charging station for the robot. 
	</p>

	<br>

	<h3>Outcome.</h3>

	<p>
		If the project is successful, it will open the door for future improvements. As feedback is collected from the testers, the project could be expand upon to improve the useability and functions of the robot. If the robot works as it is intended, elderly people would be able to purchase an assistant that is able to monitor their safety, remind them to take care of themselves, allow easy access to entertainment and knowledge online and control devices around the home. The robot assistant could also provide a sense of companionship and instil a feeling of safety in its users, especially if more personal safety functionalities are developed and improved upon.
