	<h3>My ideal job</h3>
	<p>
		My ideal job would be to work at Google as a software engineer.(The add listing linked here is in California, I was unable to find one in Melbourne). The job of a software engineer involves developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software applications. Google develops many of the most popularly used and most innovative technologies that reach all around the globe. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Working for Google as a software engineer could possibly net me a job working in the development of AI, smart home technologies, mobile apps, security tools, operating systems and so much more. I would enjoy the opportunity to be involved in the development of any of the softwareâ€™s listed above. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I have always been interested in looking at real world situations and how software can improve them. I personally use a lot of technology in the home to help my mum who is physically disabled and have seen what an impact it has had in making every day tasks more accessible for her. I would love to have a job where I can help develop similar technologies that improve the lives for people who are unable to perform tasks the average person may take for granted.
