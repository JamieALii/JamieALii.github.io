	<h3>My ideal job</h3>
	<p>
		As I said before, I do not have any experience working in IT and I also donâ€™t really have a clue about what I would like to do in the future so I decided to look for jobs at a company that I think I would really enjoy working for. I looked into jobs at Google and selected the role of a Software Engineer. I think this would be a fascinating job to have because Google is responsible for developing a wide range of technologies and software. This would give me an opportunity to work in teams with people developing anything from apps to software for self-driving vehicles. 
	</p>

	<P>
		The role of a Software Engineer at Google is fascinating and varied. In this job, you would be part of a team working on a specific software solution for one of Googles many innovative products. This could be anything from working in cyber security, AI development, self-driving technology, app development, data storage, networking and many other things.  The job allows the employee to move around to different areas of the company and work on different projects. This sounds very appealing to me because I think it would give a great experience to work with other people and learn so many different things about many different ground breaking technologies that I may never get the chance to interact with anywhere else.

	<h3>Necessary skills, qualifications and experience</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>A Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science or work experience that equivalates to the degree. </li>
		<li>Experience in programming and developing software in at least one common software development language.</li>
		<li>Experience in at least two fields related to the job, such as networking, app development, web development, machine learning, etc.  </li>

	<br>

	<h3>My current qualifications.</h3>
	<p>
		I have no experience working in the IT industry. I have a Cert IV in IT Networking that I studied at Holmesglen Institute in Chadstone. I did a short course in book keeping that I use for my current job managing accounts for my partners Wholesale business. Apart from that, most of what I know is self-taught. I have some skills in PC building and software troubleshooting. I also worked as a manager at a Shisha bar, hiring employees and managing their time tables, the business finances and ensuring the health and safety of the staff and workplace. 
	</p>
	<br>

	<h3>What I need to do to qualify for the job.</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Complete Intro to IT and Intro to Programming and use those as a pathway to study a Bachelor of Computer Science at RMIT. Apparently, that is what is needed to enter the course. </li>
		<li>Practising programming in my spare time with the use of online resources would be a great way to improve my skills and become more proficient in as many programming languages as possible.</li>
		<li>Find a job working for a company who develops software or requires software developers to gain some experience in the field.</li>
		<li>Move onto another job in a different field so I can gain a different type of experience.</li>
		<li>Apply for the job and cross my fingers. </li>
