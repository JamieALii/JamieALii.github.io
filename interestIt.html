	<h3>Interest in IT</h3>

	<p>
		My interest in IT began when we got our first PC, it was an IBM (don’t ask me the model) running windows 95, (I can still hear that blissful start up jingle). I was about 5 when we got our first computer and remember taking my Thomas the tank Engine books and typing them out in Microsoft Word because I just wanted a reason to play with the computer. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As I got older and was in primary school, I became interested in gaming and begged my mum to buy me Halo Combat Evolved. One year I received it for Christmas and as soon as we got home from visiting family, I rushed to the computer and installed it. I started a new profile and as soon as the campaign started, I noticed the game was laggy and the graphics (even back then) looked awful. I couldn’t understand why it didn’t play like it did on my friends Xbox. So, I began doing research into why these issues were occurring and spent about a year learning everything I could about computer performance and components.  

	<p>
		I was on a quest to build my very first PC, armed with an instructional book from the library, yes, the library and components that I had meticulously selected, I sat at the dining room table and spent the next six hours building my horrifically cable managed monstrosity of a PC. She was ugly but she ran Halo like a champ.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since then, I have always had an interest in IT and tend to chop and change my interests on a regular basis from things like 3D printing to VR and games. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
	<p>
		I chose to come to RMIT because I have heard about its reputation from family and friends who have attended the university in the past. The information and testimonials from students on the RMIT website were very encouraging to me and I felt the school would be a great fit. So far everything I have experienced and meeting the teachers and tutors has been a positive experience and I am looking forward to proceeding with my education with RMIT in the future.
	</p>
	

	<br>
	<h3>What do I expect to learn at RMIT?</h3>
	<p>
	During my studies, I am expecting to get a broad sense of what it will be like to work in the IT industry. Looking at the syllabus for this class, I am looking forward to exploring different areas of IT, I think this will be very helpful to me because I am still unsure of what I would like to do in the future. The course seems to cover so many exciting areas of IT such as AI, VR, robotics and cyber security, these are all subjects I have always been interesting in learning more about.
