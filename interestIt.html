	<h1><center>My interest in IT and studying at RMIT</center></h1>

	<h3>Interest in IT</h3>

	<p>My interest in IT began when I was in primary school and was introduced to a wonderful Xbox game called Halo Combat Evolved. I enjoyed this game so much; I begged my mum to buy it for me on PC because I didn’t own a console. 
		When I first played the game, I was so excited… Until I experienced the performance. It was abysmal. I began a lengthy expedition to get to the root of the enigma that was my beloved, laggy video game. 
	</p>

	<p>I found out the reason my game was so stuttery was that it wasn’t meeting even the minimum hardware requirements. Eventually, I came across the world of custom PC building and that was the solution! I asked my parents if I could buy components to build my own PC. With some convincing and the investment of all the pocket money I had saved, six months later I was sitting behind my very first, poorly cable managed, incorrectly RAIDed, gaming PC. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The PC building community is full of experts and amateurs with a huge array of skills or lack thereof, there’s so much support online to help an enthusiast like myself achieve whatever tasks I want to achieve. I actually enjoy the times when I encounter a problem, because I know I’m about to learn something new. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As anyone reading this who is interested in IT knows, once you start with one community, it leads to another, and another, and before you know it you have so many interesting IT related hobbies you want to try for yourself, it’s hard to find the spare time to do them all!
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>Why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
	<p>
		I have heard wonderful things about RMIT from friends and family who have attended. A cousin of mine studied a bachelor of IT a few years ago and was always telling me about all the interesting things he was learning at school. Since then, I always kept the idea of attending RMIT in mind, hoping one day I would be here. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I have read that RMIT partners with major companies to bring their students industry leading education. RMIT is also very focused on giving students a practical education, something I can certainly align myself with as I find I learn best with practical experience. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Although some Universities in recent years have seen drops in graduation rates, RMIT has not been one of these Universities to be heavily affected by these statistics. I believe it is the comprehensive student support that sets RMIT apart from the others. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h3>What do I expect to learn at RMIT?</h3>
	<p>
		I’m expecting as this is an introduction to IT, I will be covering a broad spectrum of topics relating to new and developing technology, networks, PC hardware, programming, web development, future technologies and concepts and how all of these things affect society, now and going forward. 
	</p>
	<p>
		From what I have already seen from my class topics, I was surprised and impressed that as students we aren’t just asked to consider the technology itself, but how it affects us as humans. The impact IT has on our societies, social lives, jobs, industries and everything else in between is important to pay attention to. The people who will eventually be responsible for producing and maintaining the technologies that impact our everyday lives need to have a comprehensive understanding of every aspect of today’s technology, including the effect it has on the people that use it.
